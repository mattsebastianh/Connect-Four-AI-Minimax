|Great job! Your code fulfills the main project requirements: you implemented your own evaluation function, set up the two AI game, and allowed for easy swapping of evaluation strategies.|||
|You could further improve your evaluation function by considering streaks in more than just the right direction, as suggested in Task 13. This will make your AI more competitive.|for col in range(len(board) - 1):   for row in range(len(board[0])):     # Check the value of board[col][row]     if  board[col][row] == "X" and board[col + 1][row] == "X":       x_two_streak += 1     if  board[col][row] == "O" and board[col + 1][row] == "O":       o_two_streak += 1|# Example: Add vertical streaks for col in range(len(board)):   for row in range(len(board[0]) - 1):     if board[col][row] == "X" and board[col][row + 1] == "X":       x_two_streak += 1     if board[col][row] == "O" and board[col][row + 1] == "O":       o_two_streak += 1|
|You left the test board and evaluation code at the bottom uncommented. For a cleaner run, comment out the test code when running the full AI game.|two_ai_game()   # mock test board new_board = make_board()  select_space(new_board, 5, "X") select_space(new_board, 5, "X") select_space(new_board, 6, "O") select_space(new_board, 6, "O") select_space(new_board, 6, "O") select_space(new_board, 6, "O")  select_space(new_board, 1, "O") select_space(new_board, 2, "O") # print_board(new_board) # print(my_evaluate_board(new_board))|two_ai_game()  # Uncomment below for testing only # new_board = make_board() # select_space(new_board, 5, "X") # ... # print_board(new_board) # print(my_evaluate_board(new_board))|
